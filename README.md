## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. **Image Upload**  
   You upload a candlestick chart screenshot.

2. **Image Processing**  
   - The image is converted to grayscale.  
   - Edges (candlestick shapes) are detected using OpenCV's `Canny` filter.

3. **Signal Estimation**  
   - The rightmost part of the chart (most recent area) is analyzed.  
   - Based on edge density, the app estimates either a BUY or SELL signal.

4. **Simulated Output**  
   Sample entry, SL, and TP values are generated for demonstration.

5. **User Comment**  
   You can optionally include your trading rationale or notes.
